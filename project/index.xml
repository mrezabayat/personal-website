The aim of this library is to provide a computational framework to address problems of cell and tissue mechanobiology for a wide range of cases and users, with special focus on curved surfaces (the cell membrane, the cell cortex, epithelial monolayers,etc.). It is designed to handle the multiphysic nature of problems in mechanobiology, to manage unstructured grids that deal with complex geometries and to allow arbitrary higher-order basis functions that describe the curvature of interfaces.</description></item></channel></rss>
